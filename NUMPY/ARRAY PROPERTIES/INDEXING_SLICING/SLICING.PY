print(arr[0:5])     #HERE WE SLICE 0-5 PART OF ARRAY
print(arr[:8])      #HERE WE ARE NOT GIVING START POINT AND STEPS      NOTE: IF WE DONT PASS STEP MEANS STEP=1 BY DEFAULT
print(arr[1:])      #HERE WE JUST PASS START POINT MEANS END IS BY DEFAULT END OF ARRAY
print(arr[::2])     #WITHOUT START AND END POINT JUST PASSED STEPS WHICH MEANS START FROM STARING POINT AND GO TO LAST END WITH THAT STEPS MEANS 2
print(arr[::-1])    # HERE WE DONT PASSES START END AGIAN MEANS START AT START AND END AT END AND PASES -1 TO STEPS MEANS START AT LAST MEAN IT WILL GIVE US REVERSED ARRAY
